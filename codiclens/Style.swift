/// Every radius, material, tint, rim and shadow in Codiclens is defined here.
/// No view outside this file holds one, and no view outside this file branches
/// on `colorScheme` — see `docs/adr/0002-liquid-glass-over-hand-rolled.md`.
///
/// There are exactly three tiers:
///
/// - **surface** — a Slab. Liquid Glass, its own hairline rim, its own shadow.
///   `slabSurface()`.
/// - **raised** — the focused Card. Brighter and a touch more defined at the
///   edge than its neighbours. No accent colour: brightness is the focus
///   signal. `cardSurface(focused: true)`.
/// - **recessed** — an unfocused Card, and every Result row or grid cell.
///   A neutral well sunk into the Slab. `cardSurface(focused: false)` and
///   `resultSurface(selected:)`.
///
/// Slabs and Cards both use `.glassEffect`, because both are top-level surfaces
/// floating over the desktop. Results are the one flat tier: they sit *inside*
/// the Results Slab, and glass stacked on glass loses the backdrop it exists to
/// reveal.
///
/// **No shadows, and no rim on a Slab.** Both were removed after they produced
/// visible artefacts, and neither can come back until the Panels are sized
/// larger than their content: a `.shadow()` on a view that fills its window is
/// clipped by the window bounds and renders as a hard band down two edges
/// rather than a falloff. `docs/DESIGN-HANDOFF.md` has the detail. A Card keeps
/// a faint rim, stroked *after* the clip so the hairline is not half cut away.

/// instead, so its tint stays thin and its rim is a light catch along the edge
/// rather than a border.
///
/// **There is no accent colour here, deliberately.** Focus and selection are
/// signalled by brightness and rim weight alone. An accent fill across a whole
/// Card turned the Panel into a coloured box, and a tinted selection fought
/// every app icon it sat next to.

    /// the Card reads as a frostier piece of the same sheet rather than a
    /// different substance — it used to be white 0.80 against a 0.22 Slab.
    ///
